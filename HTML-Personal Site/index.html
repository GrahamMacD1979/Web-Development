  <p>I am a previous Civil Servant having worked on Indigenous issues for the past 20 years.
    I have worked on various policy, management, negotiation and alternate dispute resolution areas, most recently on Specific Claims.
    I am seeking new opportunities in a field unrelated to the civil service. I have strong skills writing, analysis and problem solving. I enjoy working with others, and am self-motivated. Providing briefings, inspriring others in thier work and
    collaborating with others is what drives me. I am also learning to <strong>CODE</strong> a whole new area for me.
    At the moment I am confused as to why all this text in in italics, as I closed the italics in the first paragraph before the line. <em> I figured it out! I hadn't closed if properly!! yay me, you will now notice that the previous text isn't
      italics, but this text is! </em> and this text isn't. </p>
